## Forbes Billionaires 2024 — Data Analysis & ML Prediction

- Loaded and explored the 2024 Forbes Billionaires dataset (2,781 records).
- Cleaned data — handled missing values and converted “Net Worth” to numeric format.
- Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to visualize industries, gender, age, residence, and wealth trends.
- Built a simple Random Forest Regression model to predict billionaire net worth based on age.
- Evaluated the model (RMSE ≈ 5.97, R² ≈ -0.20) and made a sample prediction for a 50-year-old billionaire (~$6.1B).
